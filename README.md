## Hi! I'm Alex :blush:

I am a future student in the IT field. I'm a fast learning, open-minded, creative and responsible person, who's always in search of better ways of solving problems and optimizing work methods.\
At the very moment I am looking for a job connected to testing of applications, however I don't have certain experience in this field, but I'd love to invest my time into this exciting job position and dive into the world of programming.\
*<sub>P.S. I have already learned some basics*<sub> :wink: 

Some random facts about me:
 + I'm Ukrainian :yellow_heart::blue_heart:
 + I speak 4 languages :speak_no_evil:
 + I've been living in Prague for 3 years :european_castle:
 + Worked in logistics for almost a year :truck:

My current interests are:
 + Software Testing :computer:
 + JavaScript :page_with_curl:
 + HTML5/CSS3 :mahjong:

Everyhting I know from programming I learned by myself, and I'm sure that's the best way to learn something.\
Hope that one day I'll find my dream team and apply all the potential to our future projects.
