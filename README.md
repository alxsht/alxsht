## Hi! I'm Alex :blush:

I am a student in the IT field. I'm a fast learning, open-minded, creative and responsible person, who's always in search of better ways of solving problems and optimizing work methods.\
At the very moment I am looking for a job connected to testing of applications or a software. .\
*<sub>P.S. I have already learned some basics*<sub> :wink: 

Some facts about me:
 + I'm Ukrainian 
 + I speak 4 languages 
 + I've been living in Prague for 4 years 
 + I used to study biology and genetics at school

My current interests are:
 + Manual Testing 
 + Automation Testing
 + JavaScript 


 I started to learn HTML and CSS by myself and decided to apply to the university to gain a wider range of knowledge and experience. So far I've finished my third semester, and learned how the process of software development works inside the company, both from programming and business sides. I've also learned some basics of Javascript, React, Node.js, API testing in Insomnia, frontend tools like Chrome DevTools, HTML/CSS, so that I could embed this knowledge into my web development skills.\
However, I believe that the job of a Tester suits me better in terms of my abilities and skills, I am able to find even those smallest mistakes and misspells in text, and I am a very precise worker when it comes to the quality of my job.
